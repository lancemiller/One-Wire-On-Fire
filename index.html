<p>linuXautomation is a web and command line based user interface to 1Wire devices. Written in PHP/Python/HTML/Javacript for use on any device that runs a Unix/Linux variant with Python and serves PHP web pages. </p>

<p>linuXautomation accesses an ACII interface to 1Wire devices. This means linuXautomation accesses a plain old directory file structure with a typical line looking like this: 
/mnt/1wire/22.20F21A000000/temperature/38.075, 
reading these device/parameter values, and in some cases setting an ON/OFF circuit 
by writing an 0 or 1 are all that this software does to events out there on system bus. 
The power and function of linuXautomation comes in being able to name the devices 
a human-friendly name, write simple programs[1] and run/stop those same stored programs,
all within a web browser.</p>

<p>[1]example: while currentTime &lt; runTime : if OutdoorA temp is less than 30: set FridgeB to OFF</p>

<p>Note on origin of project: WiseAss Brewing Company -serving microbrews to 
the Puget Sound region of Washington State- conceived of the need for automation of
their brewing process and wanted Linux coupled with 1wire devices, and asked
Lance Miller to be the coder. WiseAss Brewing Company is headed by Ryan Hodges 
and Kurt Forsberg, and both are effective and mature proponents/users of open source
software.</p>

<p>1Wire Briefly Explained</p>

<p>Monitoring
1-wire is great for low-cost monitoring of environmental conditions (temperature, light levels, humidity, moisture,...).  There are 3rd party devices that can measure more elaborate conditions (Thermocouples for extreme temperatures, ultraviolet, wind-speed, counters. Typical uses include computer case and server room monitoring, weather stations, soil conditions, aquarium and vehicle monitoring.</p>

<p>Control
There are numerous 1-wire chips that have on-off switches (either 1,2,or 8 switches per chip). High current circuits can be built using relays. There is also 3rd party devices that have pulse-width modulation (PWM) counters and other controls, also under 1-wire supervision.</p>

<p>Instrumentation
The battery monitoring chips have (besides temperature) current and voltage sensors in different ranges.</p>

<p>Limitations
In fact, the biggest constraint is usually speed.  Fast process control and momentary contacts are difficult. Instead, 1-wire might be a good supervisory/monitoring/alarm system on top of process control. </p>
